### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 1 with Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting  

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:
•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.

### Conclusion
Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.




# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.

1. Aim

To design an effective Climate Change Awareness Campaign by applying prompt engineering techniques across multiple AI platforms, ensuring cultural relevance, audience engagement, and optimized communication channels.

2. Tools Required

AI Platforms: OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini (Bard), Cohere Command, Meta LLaMA.

Prompting Techniques: Zero-shot, Few-shot, Role-based, Chain-of-thought, Persona-driven.

Evaluation Metrics:

Relevance to audience context (age, region, culture).

Clarity of message.

Creativity and persuasiveness.

Accessibility (simple language, translations).

Engagement potential.

3. Context Questions (Campaign Design Stage)

Before crafting campaign prompts, ask:

Audience Type – Who is the target group? (students, policymakers, rural farmers, urban professionals).

Cultural Factors – What values, traditions, or beliefs influence climate perception in the region?

Communication Channels – Social media, workshops, school programs, radio, community events?

Language & Tone – Local language, storytelling, humor, scientific facts, or emotional appeal?

Call-to-Action – What behavior change is expected? (reduce plastic use, plant trees, save energy).

4. Introduction to Prompting Tools in AI Platforms

Zero-shot Prompting – Direct request without examples (good for quick campaign slogans).

Few-shot Prompting – Provide sample campaign lines for consistent style.

Role-based Prompting – Ask AI to act as “climate activist” or “school teacher” to adapt tone.

Chain-of-Thought – Step-by-step reasoning for policy briefs or climate reports.

Persona-driven Prompting – Tailor messages for specific audiences (e.g., farmers vs. students).

5. Methodology of Comparison

Define same campaign task (e.g., “Create a slogan for high-school students in India on climate change”).

Apply the same prompt style across AI platforms.

Compare outputs for relevance, cultural fit, creativity, and clarity.

Collect user feedback from small test audiences.

Evaluate engagement metrics (likes, shares, comprehension).

6. Result Comparison Table
AI Platform	Prompting Style	Output Quality	Cultural Relevance	Engagement Potential	Ease of Use
ChatGPT	Role-based	High	Strong (adapts tone)	Very High	Easy
Claude	Zero-shot	Clear, factual	Moderate	Medium	Very Easy
Gemini (Bard)	Few-shot	Creative	Good	High	Easy
Cohere	Chain-of-Thought	Analytical	Moderate	Medium	Medium
LLaMA	Persona-driven	Mixed	Variable	Moderate	Complex
7. Performance & User Experience

ChatGPT: Best for interactive, audience-tailored campaigns.

Claude: Great for factual awareness, less emotional appeal.

Gemini (Bard): Strong in creative slogans & visual storytelling.

Cohere: Better for structured policy content, less for mass campaigns.

LLaMA: Requires fine-tuning; outputs vary in quality.

8. Conclusion & Result

Prompt engineering enhances the relevance and impact of Climate Change Awareness Campaigns by customizing content to audience type, cultural factors, and communication channels. Among tested platforms, ChatGPT and Gemini performed best for creative, culturally sensitive, and engaging campaign material. Claude and Cohere are useful for policy-driven or formal contexts, while LLaMA suits technical audiences with customization.

➡️ Final Result: A multi-channel climate campaign plan can be optimized using different prompting strategies across AI platforms, ensuring local relevance, global resonance, and stronger audience engagement.
